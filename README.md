# P1-Boarding-An-Airplane
 
This is a university project, that simulates the boarding of passengers onto an airplane. The project is split into two programs; the simulation itself and a boarding method generator.
The boarding method generator creates several files, which represents the different boarding methods. A config file is used to decide how many rows, seats per row and doors there should be in the plane. The files are then used by the simulation to create the plane map.
The simulation itself takes the input of the boarding method, a config file for the different static values used in the simulation, e.g. walking speed, luggage count etc. In the program you can choose whether you want to generate an output file for the simulation, which saves the time used by every run as well as the average time used by all runs.
